I don't have a Twitch account and I don't plan to ever have one. This always bothered me though - the UI is extremely bloated if you use it without an account.
This extension accomplishes:

* Removes Twitch's purple bar asking you to signup
* Clears channel recommendations and create a custom one with local storage
* Removes buttons that require an account
* Redirects the homepage to /directory

Under development.
